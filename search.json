[{"title":"关于我","url":"/2025/04/02/%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E6%88%91/","content":"自我介绍（self-introduction)往事越千年，魏武挥鞭，东临碣石有遗篇\n自我介绍说实话与我自己的性格并不相符，一直觉得往身上框框贴标签往往只会暴露自己的粗糙，并且有种与他人拉开距离的感觉。To be honest, self introduction does not match my personality. I have always felt that putting labels on myself often only exposes my roughness and gives me a feeling of distancing myself from others.\n但是近年来我的想法也发生了一些改变，含蓄的“君子”并不太适合当下这个看脸的浮躁时代，尤其是底层出身的人群。而只有那些敢于推销自己，展示自己的人才可能更有立足之地。乐观地来讲，也许只有主动拥抱世界，世界才会反过来拥抱你。But in recent years, my thoughts have also changed a bit. The reserved “gentleman&#x2F;Saint” is not very suitable for the current impetuous era of face recognition, especially for people from lower backgrounds. Only those who dare to promote themselves and showcase themselves may have a better foothold. Optimistically speaking, perhaps only by actively embracing the world will the world embrace you in turn. \n这就是我写自我介绍的主要原因，下面将通过一个表格简要的展示我自己~This is the main reason why I am writing a self introduction. Below, I will briefly present myself through a table~\n\n\n\n属性Attribute\n值Value\n\n\n\n性别Gender\n男 Male\n\n\n政治面貌\n中共预备党员\n\n\n生日Birthday\n2003.06.19(农历五月二十)June 19, 2003 (20th day of the fifth lunar month)\n\n\n籍贯Hometown\n云南曲靖 Qujing, Yunnan\n\n\n爱好Hobbies\n软笔字，吉他，养生，读书，山地车Calligraphy, guitar, health preservation, reading, mountain biking\n\n\n下面是一张自我简历(不定时更新），目前正在为找工作发愁，大家如果愿意帮忙的话可以把这个发给招聘人员，目前自己在互联网上清清白白，身正不怕影子斜，不用太担心自己的信息问题。The following is a self resume (updated from time to time), which is currently worrying about finding a job. If you are willing to help, you can send this to the recruiters.  At present, I am clean on the Internet, and I am not afraid of shadow, so I don’t have to worry too much about my information problems.\n可以看到，我并不是一个特别优秀的人，回望过去，自己的青春特别的不值得，但是自己只能积极向前看。坦白的来讲，自己对我生活的现状谈不上满意，但是我敢于承认这一点并勇于去改变而不是否认防御。It can be seen that I am not a particularly outstanding person. Looking back, my youth was not worth it, but I can only actively look forward. To be honest, I am not satisfied with the current state of my life, but I am willing to admit it and have the courage to change it instead of denying defense.\n以一灯传诸灯，终至万灯皆明\n另外，我对自己最大的评价是“矛盾”，除了一些根本立场，我有时发现自己的念头是完全矛盾的，但是自己也很纠结应该如何去选择，因此我很少对别的人或事物发表评价，人是会变的，但是岁月也是有记忆的，从这个意义上来说，我很害怕自己那一天面对过去的自己而感到强烈的不适。In addition, my biggest evaluation of myself is “contradiction”. Apart from some fundamental positions, I sometimes find that my thoughts are completely contradictory, but I am also very conflicted about how to choose. Therefore, I rarely comment on other people or things. People can change, but time also has memories. In this sense, I am afraid of feeling strongly uncomfortable when facing my past self on that day.\n","categories":["闲谈"],"tags":["还没想好"]}]
